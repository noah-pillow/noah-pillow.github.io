      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Noah!
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal for my career is to solve interesting and difficult problems through software, and to use my software engineering skills to make people's lives more enjoyable.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was in middle school, my older brother left for college and gave me his old computer.
        It was an old HP Pavilion with 512MB RAM, an AMD Athlon 64 CPU, and a 250GB hard disk.
        Despite barely knowing how to use it at the time, I thought everything about it was cool!
        The web in particular was the coolest; I immediately wanted to learn how to build my own website, so I googled "how to make a website" and eventually found tutorials on html.net for HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
        The feedback loop of changing the markup, style, or script, refreshing the browser tab, and immediately seeing my changes was addictive, and I spent countless hours as a teenager doing just that.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was my first time interacting with software as a developer rather than as an end user.
        More than any other moment in my life, it is the one I credit for starting me on the professional path I've chosen for myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Also, like every other young male tech professional, my hobbies are working out, cooking, and watching anime ðŸ˜…)
